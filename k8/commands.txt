minikube start

kubectl create deploy hello-app --image=gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:2.0
kubectl expose deployment hello-app --type=NodePort --port=8080

kubectl apply -f combine.yml
kubectl delete -f combine.yml



with minikube:
no external ip & "curl $(minikube ip):<node_port>" dont work
need to use "minikube service hello-app" instead


with docker desktop:
still dont have external ip
but can use "curl localhost:<node_port>"

(1) If you don't see any EXTERNAL-IP, it may mean that your Kubernetes nodes do not have external IPs, so you just can't access them from outside.
(2) If you run minikube, you can check node ip with the minikube ip command. If you run Docker Desktop Kubernetes, then node ip is localhost.

(1) makes sense, and it makes docker desktop behaviour very weird. Why can I still access the service when the node don't have external ip.
What end up working is to fake node ip with localhost, but why does it work?
